## _Types of Voting_

- Paper Ballots 
- Lever Voting Machines 
- Punched Cards
- Optical Mark Sense  Ballots
- Direct Recording Electronic Voting Systems
- Electronic Voting 


## Cost and Features and Timeline
  _**Hand written paper**_ ballots were first used in Rome in 139 BCE, and their first use in America was in 1629, to
select a pastor for the Salem church.

_**Lever voting machines**_ were first used in 1892 in New York, and were slowly adopted across the country.
They completely eliminate most of the approaches to manipulating the vote count that were endemic a century
ago, and they can easily be configured to handle a complex general election ballot.

_**Punched card**_ data processing dates back to the 1890's, but IBM did not introduce the
Votomatic punched card voting system until 1964.

_**Optical mark-sense voting systems**_ were developed in the early 1970's by American Information Systems of
Omaha, alternately in competition with and in cooperation with Westinghouse Learning Systems of Iowa City. 

The newest voting technology uses _**direct-recording electronic voting**_ machines. These were developed after
microcomputers became sufficiently inexpensive that they could be incorporated into a voting machine. The
first of these was developed by Shoup in 1978
